# Sales Data Analysis (Internship Task 5)

A professional, reusable analysis script that performs exploratory analysis and basic visualizations on sales CSV files.

## Overview
This repository contains `analysis.py` — an internship-grade Python script which:
- Loads a CSV file (Pandas)
- Performs descriptive statistics and missing-value checks
- Aggregates using `groupby()` and `sum()`
- Produces plots (saved to `outputs/`)
- Writes a short textual report (`outputs/report.txt`)

## Requirements
- Python 3.8+
- Packages:
  ```bash
  pip install pandas matplotlib

---

## Next steps I can do for you (pick any)
- ✅ Create ZIP with `analysis.py` + `README.md` (I can produce it now)
- ✅ Convert `analysis.py` into a Jupyter Notebook (`analysis.ipynb`) with visual outputs embedded
- ✅ Provide a small sample `sales_sample.csv` (synthetic) so you can test immediately
- ✅ Add code comments and docstrings to the notebook for explanation (useful for interviews)
- ✅ Produce screenshots of the plots

Tell me which of the options above you want me to do next (for example: **"make zip"** or **"create notebook and sample csv"**).
